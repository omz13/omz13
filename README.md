### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Gen X dude who is morphing into an internet greybeard with misanthropic tendencies because you never learn from history and keep making the same stupid mistakes; I have been online since the days of 300 baud acoustic couplers; I cut my teeth, like everybody else in 197x, programming BASIC and 6502 assembler; these days I'm into Go and Swift

I have opinions and preferences, deal with them:
- tabs not spaces
- vi not emacs
- I like my programming languages strongly typed
- Oxford comma FTW
- Agile is performnance art[^1]

I highly recommend that, if you haven;t done so already, read _Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture_, _Neuromancer_, _Stranger in a Strange Land_, and _Zen and the Art of Motocycle Maintenance_

These days you are likely to encounter me because I am involved (or not[^indieweb-snooze]) with [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org)

[^1]: I have an advanced degree in Visual Art (MFA) so I know bollocks when I see it
[^indieweb-snooze]: Because some people in #indieweb-dev behave like "Quiche Eaters"

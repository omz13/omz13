### Hi there 👋

I am a Gen X dude who has been online since the days of 300 baud acoustic couplers; I cut my teeth, like everybody else in 197x, programming BASIC and 6502 assembler; these days I'm into Go and Swift.

I highly recommend that, if you haven't done so already, read _Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture_, _Neuromancer_, _Stranger in a Strange Land_, and _Zen and the Art of Motocycle Maintenance_

These days you are likely to encounter me because I am involved (or not[^indieweb-snooze]) with [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org)

[^indieweb-snooze]: Because some people in #indieweb-dev behave like "Quiche Eaters"

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Gen X dude who has been online since the days of 300 baud acoustic couplers; I cut my teeth, like everybody else in 197x, programming BASIC and 6502 assembler; these days I'm into Go and Swift.

I highly recommend that, if you haven't already done so, read _Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture_, _Neuromancer_, _Stranger in a Strange Land_, and _Zen and the Art of Motocycle Maintenance_.

I do indie web; I am on the periphery[^indieweb-snooze] of [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) 

[^indieweb-snooze]: I was more involved but am distancing myself because of some people in #indieweb-dev who are just "Quiche Eaters"[^quiche-eaters].
[^quiche-eaters]: this is an oblique reference to the fact that there's a lot of pushback, double-standards, and hypocracy happening despite everyone saying they're against such things.

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have opinions and preferences:
- tabs not spaces
- vi not emacs

I am involved with aspects of [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org): I like some of their [principles](https://indieweb.org/principles) but am very wary of their shibboleths[^1] and pushback[^2]; I built a multi-tenant IndieAuth server; I built a multi-tenant CMS that is IndieWeb-friendly.

[^1]: The fact that they don't even reference their shibboleths is telling.
[^2]: What happens when you mention one of the shibboleths, let alone try to question it.

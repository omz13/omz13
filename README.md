### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Gen X cisgender dude (he/him) who has been online since the days of 300 baud acoustic couplers; I cut my teeth, like everybody else in 197x, programming BASIC and 6502 assembler while listening to the _Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ radio show; these days I'm into Go and SwiftUI and my tcp/ip packets arrive via an optical-fiber cable.

I highly recommend that, if you haven't already done so, read _Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture_, _Neuromancer_, _Stranger in a Strange Land_, and _Zen and the Art of Motocycle Maintenance_.

I am very much indie web, and to a far lesser extent [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) because reasons[^indieweb-sucks].

[^indieweb-sucks]: i) pushback, double-standards, and hypocrisy; ii) groupthink and confirmation bias; iii) diminishing relevance

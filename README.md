### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have opinions and preferences:
- tabs not spaces
- vi not emacs

I am involved with some of the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org); I like their [principles](https://indieweb.org/principles) but are wary of their shibboleths [^1]

[^1]: The fact that they don't even reference their shibboleths is telling.

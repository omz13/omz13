### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Gen X dude (he/him) who has been online since the days of 300 baud acoustic couplers; I cut my teeth, like everybody else in the early 1980s, programming BASIC and 6502 assembler while listening to the _Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ radio show; these days I'm into Go and SwiftUI and my tcp/ip packets arrive via an optical-fiber cable (FTTH FTW).

I'm married with children. _La famille avant tout_.

If you haven't already done so, I highly recommend that you read Douglas Coupland's _Microserfs_, William Gibson's _Neuromancer_, Robert A. Heinlein's _Stranger in a Strange Land_, and Robert M. Pirsig's _Zen and the Art of Motocycle Maintenance_.

I make things[^my-iw-things] for the _web_ but I'm distancing[^indieweb-hiatus] myself from [_IndieWeb_](https://indieweb.org/) because reasons[^indieweb-sucks].

[^my-iw-things]: a multi-tenant CMS with microformats as its native format; an IdP/AS supporting IndieAuth and more; federation via ActivityPub, etc.
[^indieweb-hiatus]: taking an extended hiatus.
[^indieweb-sucks]: groupthink, confirmation bias, hypocrisy, technical immaturity, lack of resilience, diminishing relevance, and most especially the pushback in #indieweb-dev.

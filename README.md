### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Gen X dude (he/him) who has been online since the days of 300 baud acoustic couplers; I cut my teeth, like everybody else in 197x, programming BASIC and 6502 assembler while listening to the _Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ radio show; these days I'm into Go and SwiftUI and my tcp/ip packets arrive via an optical-fiber cable.

If you haven't already done so, I highly recommend that you read _Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture_, _Neuromancer_, _Stranger in a Strange Land_, and _Zen and the Art of Motocycle Maintenance_.

I am very much _indie web_; even though I made things[^my-iw-things] for it, I am very much less into [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/) because  confirmed reasons[^indieweb-sucks]

[^my-iw-things]: A multi-tenant CMS; an IndieAuth IdP/AS; etc.
[^indieweb-sucks]: i) groupthink, confirmation bias, and especially the pushback in #indieweb-dev; ii) hypocrisy and double-standards; iii) diminishing relevance.

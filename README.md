### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Gen X dude (he/him) who has been online since the days of 300 baud acoustic couplers; I cut my teeth, like everybody else in the early 1980's, programming BASIC and 6502 assembler while listening to the _Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy_ radio show; these days I'm into Go and SwiftUI and my tcp/ip packets arrive via an optical-fiber cable.

If you haven't already done so, I highly recommend that you read _Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture_, _Neuromancer_, _Stranger in a Strange Land_, and _Zen and the Art of Motocycle Maintenance_.

I made things[^my-iw-things] for IndieWeb; I am very much _indieweb_ but currently not so much into [_IndieWeb_](https://indieweb.org/) because reasons[^indieweb-sucks] and diminishing relevance[^relevance]

[^my-iw-things]: A multi-tenant CMS with microformats as its native format; an IdP/AS supporting IndieAuth; etc.
[^indieweb-sucks]: groupthink, confirmation bias, hypocrisy, low CMMI, and most especially the pushback in #indieweb-dev
[^relevance]: In a "fight" between IndieWeb (Microformats+WebMentions) and Fediverse (ActivityStreams/ActivityPub), IndieWeb is like betamax and Fediverse is like VHS, and we all know how that ended
